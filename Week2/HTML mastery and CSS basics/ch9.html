        <tr><td>MP4</td>
        <td>Video</td>
        <td>MPEG-4, also known as MP4, is the most common file type for videos. The MP4 format is the standard format for web videos because MP4 videos are high-quality with relatively small file sizes. Not only is MP4 the standard for the web, but this video format is also used for TV. If you’re adding a video to your website or uploading a video to YouTube, using an MP4 video format is a safe bet.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>WebM</td>
        <td>Video</td>
        <td>The WebM format was developed by Google and released in 2019 as HTML5 grew in popularity. This video format is specifically designed for the web, but the biggest issue it faces is a lack of support. WebM videos have an extremely small file size without sacrificing too much in terms of quality. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer and Safari don’t offer support for WebM videos unless you use additional plugins. The result is that MP4 is still the champion in terms of the best web video types.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ogg</td>
        <td>video</td>
        <td>Ogg is a multimedia container format that can store and play video files. Ogg is open-source and can store audio, video, text, and metadata. Ogg video files have the file extension .ogv</td></tr>
        <tr><td>MP3</td>
        <td>Audio</td>
        <td>MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III) is the most popular of the lossy formats. MP3 files work on most devices and the files can be as small as one-tenth the size of lossless files. MP3 is fine for the consumer, since most of the sound it drops is inaudible, but that’s not the case when it comes to bit depth. “MP3 files can only be up to 16-bit, which is not what you want to be working in,” says producer, mixer and engineer Gus Berry. “You want to be working in at least 24-bit or higher when recording and mixing.”

        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>Ogg Vorbis</td>
        <td>audio</td>
        <td>Ogg Vorbis is the free, open-source audio codec that Spotify uses. It’s great for streaming, but the compression results in some data loss. Experts consider it a more efficient format than MP3, with better sound at the same bitrate. </td></tr>
        <tr><td>WAV</td>
        <td>audio</td>
        <td>WAV is a lossless audio file format that retains all the original audio data. WAV files are known for their high quality and are often used by audio professionals</td></tr>
